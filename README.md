# StarTraveler
A tiny tool to visit our near neighboursâ€™ stars and understand how constellations are positioned in 3D

# Build

inside the StarTraveler directory, execute the following commands:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

Then, all you have to do is to execute the binary with and give it a stars file (there will be one in the build directory):

    $ ./StarTraveler stars.txt
